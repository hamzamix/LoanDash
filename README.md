## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git:** For cloning the repository
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** For containerized deployment
  - [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (Windows/macOS)
  - [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (Linux)
  - [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Linux)

### 🐳 Docker Deployment (Recommended)

The fastest way to get LoanDash running using the pre-built Docker image:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamzamix/LoanDash.git
   cd LoanDash
   ```
   
2.  **Alternatively:**
   
    you can manually download just the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/hamzamix/LoanDash/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file if you prefer

3. **Start the Application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Pull the latest `hamzamix/loandash` image from Docker Hub
   - Create a persistent volume `loandash-data` for data storage
   - Start the container on port 8050
   - Initialize the database at `/data/db.json`

4. **Access Your Application:**
   ```
   http://<Your Server IP>:8050
   ```

### 🔄 Updating the Application

When new versions are available:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/LoanDash
docker-compose pull loandash
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```

Your data will be preserved during updates thanks to Docker volume persistence.

### 🛠️ Development Setup

For local development and testing:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Access at `http://localhost:5183`

3. **Build for Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Start Production Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🏗️ Architecture

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `DATA_FILE_PATH`: Custom path for data file (default: `/data/db.json`)
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)

### Docker Volumes
- `loandash-data:/data` - Persistent storage for application data

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port 8050 already in use:**
```bash
docker-compose down
# Check for conflicting services on port 8050
docker-compose up -d
```

**Data not persisting:**
- Ensure Docker volume `loandash-data` exists
- Check volume mounting in `docker-compose.yml`

**Application not loading:**
- Verify Docker container is running: `docker ps`
- Check container logs: `docker-compose logs loandash`
